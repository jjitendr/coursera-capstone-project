    "The idea is to group neighborhoods that have similar characteristics i.e. schools followed by grocery shops and restaurants. There are 38 neighborhoods in Toronto containing Toronto in the Borough name. On exploring venues using Foursquare, I see that there are 34 neighborhoods with Parks and 30 neighborhoods with Restaurants in a 500 meter radius around the neighborhood location. For Parks and Restaurants, I group by neighborhood to get the counts.\n",

    "Since the first criteria is School, we narrow down our list to the neighborhoods having good elementary schools. For this I check elementary school in all 38 neighborhoods using the school data and find 29 elementary schools with rating >= 8. Next I group these schools by neighborhood to get the mean rating. Finally I have 16 neighborhoods with good schools to looks at. \n",

    "Now I merge these 16 neighborhoods with the Parks and Restaurants dataset to arrive at our final data for clustering. Among these 16 neighborhoods, I have few with either no parks or no restaurants.\n",

    "Finally I run kmeans clustering on this final dataset with a cluster size of 4. The kmeans clustering algorithm does a good job in clustering the neighborhoods based on schools, parks and restaurants. The results show that majority of neighborhoods i.e. 8 out of 16 have the same characteristics. They have good schools, few parks and very few restaurants. The next two big clusters have 3 neighborhoods each. School ratings are almost the same whereas one has fewer parks and restaurants than the other. The smallest cluster has only one neighborhood with a very high school rating and a lot of restaurants. Based on these clusters, one can recommend a neighborhood to a family or let the family choose a neighborhood based on this result set.\n"
